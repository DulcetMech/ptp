    <td width="70%" valign="top">The MPI Language Tools framework
has been generalized into a static analysis framework, the Parallel Language
Development Tools (PLDT). This will allow other
programming models and parallel languages to use the static analysis
features.

    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Build improvements</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">PTP supports a large range of
machine architectures, operating systems and parallel runtime
systems.
In 1.1, dynamically linked executables have  been deprecated, and
build scripts have been improved so this only requires one command
for PTP installation.

		<a name="MonitorType">Monitor Data Element</a>
	</h2>

	<p>At present, the monitor component has less elements to define;
		this may change in future releases, when certain hard-coded features
		of the driver may be handed over to the client for configuration.</p>

	<img alt="MonitorType" src="images/24monitor.jpeg" />

	<p>
	   This component can be furnished with its own set of properties
	   (currently unused). What is necessary to set at present is only the <i>schedulerType</i>
	   attribute. It specifies the target system's job scheduler. Currently supported batch systems are 
	   COBALT_BG, GRIDENGINE, LL, LL_BG, LSF, OPENMPI, PBS, PE, SLURM, SLURM_ALPS, TORQUE and TORQUE_ALPS.
	   These names can be used as attribute values for <i>schedulerType</i>.
	   <i>refreshFrequencyInSeconds</i> defaults to
	   60, but this can be changed according to the needs of the user. Be
	   aware that too low a setting will probably not work, as the command on
	   an average sized system will take upwards of five seconds to complete
	   (XML is being streamed to the driver and a
	   <code>diff</code>
	   is sent back to the client ).
	</p>

	<p>
		If the
		<code>driver</code>
		element is configured, then the default behavior, which is to stage
		over the necessary driver scripts to the <i>.eclipsesettings</i>
		directory in the user's home, is overridden by connecting to a
		pre-existent installation. This can be specified either using the
		<code>url</code>, or a combination of the
		<code>name</code>,
		<code>path</code>
		and
		<code>args</code>
		elements.

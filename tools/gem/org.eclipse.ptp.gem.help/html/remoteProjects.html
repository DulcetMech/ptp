<h3>GEM supports remote and synchronized C/C++ MPI projects whose connections are through one of the following remote service providers:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/remoteTools.html">Built-in SSH</a> (default)</li>
	<li>Remote Tools (now deprecated in PTP 8.0)</li>
	<li>Remote System Explorer</li>
</ul>

<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP),  

<h3>Target machine requirements:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/formal_verification/ISP-release/">ISP</a> version 0.3.0 or later</li>
	<li>
		<b>C/C++ Compiler</b>
	</li>    
    <li>
		<b>Some implementation of MPI</b> must be installed, OpenMPI and MPICH2 both work well. If you are using MPICH v1.2 or lower, 
		you will also need to have your process manager (e.g. mpd) and running. GEM assumes your process manager is already 
		running when it is loaded. If you are using MPICH2 v1.3 or later with Hydra, you don&#39;t need to worry about this.
	</li>
		
</ul>

<p>
GEM operates and behaves identically with local, remote and synchronized C/C++ MPI projects. 
The only limitation is that GEM currently does not support the <a href="happensBeforeViewer.html">
Happens Before Viewer</a> with remote and synchronized projects, as it is an external tool.
The <a href="happensBeforeViewer.html"> Happens Before Viewer</a> will soon be integrated into
a new GEM view.
